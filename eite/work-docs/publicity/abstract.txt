This is a project to develop a document-centric computing environment and data format. It is a proposal, design, specification, and (as of now prototype) implementation for an information technology system. The computing environment would be comprised of a centralized append-only information store, a computer operating system user interface integrated with that information store, and related specifications. The computing environment proposed here is distinct from existing technologies in that it attempts to provide superior flexibility by representing all information and documents it uses or processes (including its own software) as strings of text in a Unicode-based character encoding extended for this purpose.
